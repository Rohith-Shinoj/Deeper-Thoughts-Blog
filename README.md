2. Add frontmatter at the top of the file replacing as relevent:

```mdx
---
title: 'My First Post'
date: '2025-06-15'
lastmod: '2025-060-15'
author: 'Rohith Shinoj Kumar'
draft: false
summary: 'An intro to my thoughts on tech, AI, and creativity.'
tags: ['machine learning', 'AI', 'personal']
---

---
```

3. Write your content below the frontmatter using MDX syntax. You can embed React components, add code blocks, images, and more.

#### üß† Tips

- Store your images in `public/static/images/[blog-folder]` and reference them using relative paths.
- Use semantic headings (`##`, `###`, etc.) to structure your content.
- You can embed custom components like `<CodeBlock />`, `<Tweet />`, etc., as long as they're defined in your `components/`.
