# Welcome to the Article Editor!

This is your starting template. Here are some tips to get you started:

## Headings

Use markdown hash symbols (#) for headings. The number of hashes determines the level of the heading.

# H1 - The main title (usually the same as the frontmatter title)

## H2 - Main sections

### H3 - Sub-sections

#### H4 - And so on...

The Table of Contents on the left is automatically generated from H2 and H3 headings.

## Text Formatting

- **Bold text:** `**Bold text**`
- _Italic text:_ `*Italic text*`
- `Code snippets:` `` `Code snippets` ``
- [Links](https://example.com)

## Images

To add an image, you can either:

1.  **Upload it:** Use the "Upload Image" button in the sidebar. This is the recommended method. It will place the image in the correct directory and give you the markdown to copy.

2.  **Use an external link:** Use the standard markdown image syntax with a URL to an image hosted elsewhere.

    `![Alt text for the image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)`

## Code Blocks

For multi-line code blocks, use triple backticks and specify the language for syntax highlighting.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It's great for highlighting important information.

## Lists

### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Nested Item 2a

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
