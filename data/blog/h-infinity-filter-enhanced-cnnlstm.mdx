Models today are getting bigger and smarter, surpassing new benchmarks every other day. Yet, for all their sophistication, most of the focus is on achieving peak performance on pristine, well-behaved datasets. This often makes us forget one equally important factor: **noise**. Real-world observations are inherently noisy and don't always adhere to perfect benchmarks, and this is one of the issues we try to tackle through this work. This is a crucial issue, especially in medicine, and it's precisely what we've tackled through our latest work on **arrhythmia detection** from heart sound recordings.

## The Problem: When Real-World Noise Obscures a Life-Saving Diagnosis

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality worldwide. The early detection of irregularities like **heart arrhythmias** (rhythms that are too fast, too slow, or erratic) is crucial to preventing severe complications such as strokes, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.

While deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to automate the diagnosis of heart conditions from audio recordings—specifically **phonocardiograms (PCG)**—existing models often struggle to generalize when faced with the messy reality of clinical data.

The challenges, as seen in the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, are threefold:

1. **Noise and Artifacts:** Real heart sound recordings are full of noise components and high-frequency artifacts that can drastically impair the performance of arrhythmia detection models.
2. **Small and Imbalanced Datasets:** Biomedical data is often limited, and the distribution is severely skewed. The dataset we used shows a notable skew, with roughly **87%** (5154 samples) classified as normal, and a minority (771 samples) as abnormal heart sounds.
3. **Generalization:** Current models often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially when dealing with small or noisy datasets.

We set out to build an architecture that is not just accurate but also **robust** to these real-world challenges.

## An Adaptive Memory Inspired by Control Theory - The H$_{\infty}$ Filter Enhanced CNN-LSTM

Before any deep model sees the data, we apply a dual-stage denoising pipeline to each heart sound. First, a discrete wavelet transform breaks the audio into multi-scale frequency components, capturing the rhythmic structure across time scales. Next, a low-pass IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filter smooths the wavelet result, suppressing high-frequency artifacts that usually carry noise, which are later converted into Mel Spectrograms.

Our solution is a novel deep learning architecture called the **CNN-H$_{\infty}$-LSTM**, which processes **Mel spectrograms** of heart rhythm audio. The CNN layers identify spatial features, while the LSTM layers track temporal dependencies.

### Re-engineering the LSTM Cell: H$_{\infty}$ Filter Integration

We substituted the default **forget gate** of the LSTM with a parameterized mechanism inspired by the **H-Infinity ($H_{\infty}$) filter** from control theory, creating a new recurrent unit called the $H_{\infty}$ LSTM cell.

The $H_{\infty}$ filter is designed to provide a guaranteed bound on estimation error even under unknown-but-bounded disturbances and model inaccuracies. By passing a trainable parameter $K_{filter}$ through a sigmoid activation to derive a robustness coefficient, $\lambda_{h}$ ], our model can dynamically control the trade-off between retaining past memory and incorporating new information. This allows the model to learn a **more robust, data-driven forgetting mechanism** compared to the gradient-based updates in standard LSTMs

![H-infinity Filter Enhanced CNN-LSTM Architecture](/static/images/hinfinity/architecture.png)

Our architecture combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

- **CNN for Spatial Feature Extraction**: The spectrogram is first processed by a series of convolutional blocks. Each block contains two **3x3 convolutional layers** with "same" padding, followed by **Batch Normalization** to stabilize training and a **2x2 MaxPooling layer** to downsample the feature maps.
- **The H$_{\infty}$-LSTM for Temporal Analysis**: The core innovation lies in replacing the standard LSTM **forget gate** with a mechanism inspired by the **H-Infinity ($H_{\infty}$) filter**. While a normal LSTM computes its cell state as $c_{t}=f_{t}c_{t-1}+i_{t}\tilde{c}_{t}$, our version replaces the volatile forget gate ($f_t$) with a stable, learnable **robustness coefficient ($\lambda_{h}$)**:

  $c_{t}=(1-\lambda_{h})c_{t-1}+\lambda_{h}i_{t}\tilde{c}_{t}$

  This provides a guaranteed bound on estimation error, allowing the model's memory to remain stable even when processing noisy, unpredictable inputs.

### Tackling Class Imbalance

To address the extreme skew in the data, we introduced a custom training strategy:

- **Penalty-Weighted Loss (PWL):** This custom loss function dynamically adjusts the loss based on the model's misclassification behavior, with a particular focus on **false negatives** and **false positives**, which are critical in medical diagnosis.

- **Stochastic Adaptive Probe Thresholding (SAPT):** This adaptive framework dynamically learns the optimal decision threshold $\tau^{*}$ during training to maximize a task-specific metric like the F1-score. This prevents the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Why the leap? The H∞ filtering makes the temporal model highly robust to real-world distortions, and the custom training loss/threshold ensure sensitivity to the rare positives. Together, the network isn’t just memorizing “clean” samples; it’s learning to ignore spurious noise.
This high level of performance means a more reliable system that can significantly change how we approach cardiac screening:

- **Robustness in Clinics:** The integration of the $H_{\infty}$ filter improves robustness against noise and variability, leading to a higher degree of generalization on small and noisy datasets. This is crucial for clinical settings.
- **Scalable and Low-Cost Screening:** The end-to-end design enables **real-time deployment on mobile or edge devices**, supporting scalable and low-cost cardiac screening.

By prioritizing **robustness** and intelligently handling the imperfections of real-world data, the $\text{CNN-H}_{\infty}\text{-LSTM}$ architecture takes us a critical step closer to delivering scalable, highly reliable, and life-saving cardiac screening to a global population.

## Future Work

Modern ML must move beyond chasing leaderboard scores on pristine data. Especially in healthcare and edge computing, we deal with low-power devices and messy signals. The H∞-augmented LSTM is an example of bringing control-theoretic robustness into deep nets, acting like an automatic noise filter built into the model.

Looking ahead, such techniques – robust filtering, adaptive thresholds, loss shaping – should become more mainstream as ML expands into the wild and we move closer to ML systems that work in practice, not just in theory
