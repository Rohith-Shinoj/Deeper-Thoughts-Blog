Modern AI agents are getting smarter — **but they’re still terrible collaborators**. Each model operates in its own bubble and have:

- No memory of past steps
- No awareness of other agents
- No shared understanding of the user’s goal

This leads to what we call **context fragmentation** — a major bottleneck in building multi-agent AI systems, assistants, or tools that actually work together.

That’s where **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** comes in. MCP is a lightweight standard that lets AI agents share a common context, synchronize goals, and reason together. This article explores what MCP is, how it fits into the AI landscape, and how you can set up a simple MCP server to power context-aware AI agents like ChatGPT.

## MCP: The Tech behind Context-Aware AI

MCP stands for **Model Context Protocol** — a communication standard that allows **AI agents, tools, or models** to share and synchronize contextual information in real time.

At its core, MCP is not about "controlling" agents — it's about helping them **coordinate**.

You can think of it like a **shared bulletin board** or **workspace**:

- Agents can **write** things they’ve learned (“user wants a summary of today’s news”)
- Other agents can **read** and respond accordingly (“I'll fetch articles from news sources”)
- Context evolves over time, but is **centrally visible** to all participants

This allows multiple agents — or even different components of a single system — to remain aligned and avoid redundant work or misinterpretations.

## MCP Clients vs Servers

MCP arctitectures follow a client-server protocol with clear distinction of roles:

**MCP Server**:

- Stores key-value pairs representing session memory, tasks, agent states, etc.
- Handles **incoming context updates** and **serves current context** on request.
- Typically lightweight and stateless — think of it like a Redis or in-memory document store.

**MCP Clients**:

- These are your **AI agents**, tools, or wrappers (like ChatGPT).
- Clients **send context updates** (e.g., “current task = booking a flight”) and **subscribe** to changes.

This architecture is intentionally simple and general-purpose — allowing you to plug in agents running different models, on different stacks, written in different languages.

## When Should You Use MCP?

You don’t need MCP for a simple chatbot that answers one-off questions. The role of MCP only becomes prominent if you're building **multi-step agents, autonomous systems, or anything involving tool use**.

**Use MCP if you need:**

- A way for agents to share **user goals, task history, or intermediate state**
- Real-time collaboration between multiple AI models (e.g., one for retrieval, one for summarization)
- A shared “working memory” across a session, device, or organization
- Better **observability** into what agents are doing and why

**Example Scenarios:**

- A ChatGPT agent that delegates parts of a task to specialized tools (calendar lookup, email summarization)
- An AI-powered assistant with memory that persists across sessions
- Agents that coordinate tasks in a workflow engine (e.g., LangGraph or Autogen)

## How to Set Up an MCP Server (Conceptually)

Let’s walk through what it _means_ to set up an MCP server — without diving into code.

### 1. Choose Your Context Storage

Your MCP server needs a place to store context. This could be:

- An in-memory store (e.g., Python dictionary if prototyping)
- A Redis or key-value database (for reliability and scale)
- A document store like MongoDB (if you want structured memory per session)

Example structure for key-value pairs (most common):

```json
{
  "user_intent": "book a flight",
  "last_tool_used": "calendar-checker",
  "session_notes": "user prefers morning flights"
}
```

### 2. Expose the required API

Your MCP server acts like a context registry. Agents interact with it via simple HTTP endpoints, such as:

- POST /context — to set or update context values
- GET /context/&#123;agent_key&#125; — to retrieve a specific context item

For example, an agent might send:

```http
POST /context
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "key": "user_goal",
  "value": "summarize latest news articles"
}
```

### 3. Connect Your Agents (Like ChatGPT)

Once your server is live, you configure your agents (like a ChatGPT plugin or wrapper) to:

- Push updates when their internal state changes
- Read context before taking any action

---

## Example workflow setup

Once your MCP server is running and storing shared context, multiple AI agents can collaborate smoothly by reading from and writing to this shared memory. Imagine a travel-planning scenario with three agents:
| Agent Name | Role | Interaction with MCP Server |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ChatGPT | Orchestrates conversation and user interaction | Reads user goals and task progress from MCP before replying |
| Flight Search Bot | Searches flights based on criteria | Reads user preferences from MCP; writes available flight options back to MCP. |

> User says: "Help me book a business trip to San Francisco."

1. ChatGPT Assistant writes to MCP:

```json
{
  "user_intent": "plan business trip to San Francisco",
  "current_task": "search flights"
}
```

2. Flight Search Bot reads user_intent and current_task from MCP, performs flight queries, then writes:

```json
{
  "flight_options": ["Flight A", "Flight B", "Flight C"],
  "current_task": "select flight"
}
```

3. ChatGPT Assistant reads updated flight_options from MCP, presents them to the user, and waits for selection.

4. Once the user selects a flight, ChatGPT Assistant updates MCP:

```json
{
  "selected_flight": "Flight B",
  "current_task": "book calendar"
}
```

This cycle continues, with all agents sharing and synchronizing context via the MCP server — enabling a smooth, multi-step, multi-agent workflow without direct coupling.

## Next Steps

If you're excited by the idea of multi-agent systems and smarter AI workflows:

- Check out frameworks like [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) or [Autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/)
- Try building your own MCP-compatible tool
- Read up on OpenAI's [ChatGPT tools API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling)

And if you're building your own agent infrastructure, adding an MCP server might be the best way to give your agents **shared context — and shared purpose**.
