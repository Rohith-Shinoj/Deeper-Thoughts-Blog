Hi! I'm Rohith Shinoj Kumar, an incoming Research Engineer at the Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT) and a recent Computer Science and Engineering graduate from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK), India.
My research interests include Computer Vision, Audio/Signal Processing and Large Language Models, with a broader focus on Neural Optimization and the Mechanistic Interpretability of Deep-Learning architectures.
I also have experience in MLOps and Full-Stack Development, having worked on end-to-end systems that bridge research and deployment.

Looking forward to connect! Feel free to reach out in case of suggestions, ideas or opportunities to work together.
